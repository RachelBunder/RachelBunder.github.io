## Experience

### Solar Analytics
Designing algorithms to detect faults in residential solar systems and provide insights resident’s energy usage. And any other data wrangling that needs to happen.


**Senior Data Scientist**

*January 2019 - July 2020*
* Built data  infrastructure in AWS, using EMR, glue and athena, to easily able to provide datasets to external parties
* Produced business cases for future analytical projects
* Instigated an onboarding process for all new interns and employees.
* As privacy officer, ensured Australian Privacy Principles and other international standards were adhered to
* Conceived and organised an annual data symposium to promote Solar Analytics as a leader in energy data in Australia


**Data Scientist**

*April 2016 - January 2019*
* Designed a method using Kalman filters to better detect potential solar panel faults, reducing the number of solar performance tickets by 90%
* Using statistical techniques, reduced the number of false positives by 20% and reduced the time taken to detect when solar panels have stopped producing energy.
* Explored other potential algorithm improvements using machine learning techniques such as random forests and artificial neural networks
* Designed the Google Analytics implementation and provided regular insights on user engagement and experience, and gave analytics insights from user surveys including NPS
* Created and reported on business metrics relating to the subscription model

### Mathematics and Computer Science Tutor, University of Wollongong  and University of Newcastle
*January 2008 - July 2014*

*  Engaged students through tutoring huh and marking for a variety of mathe- matics and computer science subjects and catered for a range of skills and backgrounds
* Produced university level mathematics course materials
* Taught students practical skills such as C++, Matlab, Arena and Excel

## Education

### Postgraduate Research (Mathematics), University of Newcastle
*June 2011 - February 2016*
Two research projects Picking Items for Experimental Sets And Heuristics for Integer Programs, supervised by Prof. Natashia Boland.
* Using Mixed Integer Programming to create methods that can be used to select unbiased sets of data
* Exploring different projection methods to find intersections between sets to be used as a heuristic for Mixed Integer Programming

### B Mathematics (Hons)/B Computer Science, University of Wollongong
*March 2006 - November 2010*

Honours’ thesis titled Artificial Intelligence for Microsimulations, supervised by Dr. Ian Piper
* Created an intelligence module which mimics belief transfer between agents
* Used simulations to model terrorist threats to Sydney Central station


## Volunteering

### Co-chair of Science and Data Stream,  PyConAu
2019, 2020

Responsibilities include advertising the science and data steam call for proposals, reviewing and selecting talks, chairing the talks on the day

### Sydney Python meetup organiser
*2015-present*

I organise a monthly meetup for the python community in Sydney. Responsibilities include inviting potential speakers and liaising with the venue

## Projects

### __[What is the most common street name in Australia?](https://github.com/RachelBunder/streetNameProject)__
Inspired by a news article which showed that many street names in the USA were plant names, I decided to find out what is the most common street name in Australia. I have presented this work at many conferences including YOW! Data, Linux Conference Australia and Pycon Australia.
Tools: Python, geopandas, Open Street Map, jupyter

### __[Weather Context](https://github.com/RachelBunder/weather_context)__
This is a twitter bot. @weather_context, that tweets the daily minimum and maximum and how it compares to the historical norm. The goal was to create a simple tool that puts our current climate in context
Tools: Python, AWS Lambda, scrapy, tweepy
